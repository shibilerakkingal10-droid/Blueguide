Many fishermen go far into the sea where there is no internet 
connection. Because of this, they cannot use online apps or search 
for important information while fishing. At the same time, traditional 
fishing knowledge—such as the best time to fish, how to 
understand wind and tides, how to stay safe during storms, and how 
to take care of boats—is slowly being lost. 
To solve this problem, we are creating an offline AI mobile app 
specially designed for fishermen and coastal communities. The app 
stores important fishing knowledge directly inside the phone, so it 
works even without internet. Fishermen can ask questions in simple 
language, and the app will give answers from the stored knowledge, 
like a chatbot. 
The app also has an offline map feature that shows useful 
information such as weather conditions, fish density areas, and 
basic navigation help. It is simple, lightweight, and works smoothly 
even on basic smartphones. 
This app combines traditional fishing wisdom with modern 
technology to help fishermen make safer and better decisions at 
sea.
